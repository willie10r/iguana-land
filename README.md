## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is a web app we are building to help me come to grips with tailwind and next.js. The project will also help me learn firebase as a backend solution.
Iguana land web app is to help new and exp iguana owner's get a mixed diet together for their lizard weekly with little to no effort.
No need to worry about what they can and cannot eat the meal plan will give 3 staple food's along with 1 treat for the week. The meal plan's
change from week to week so they won't get board.

Here's why:
* To get a better understanding of next.js.
* Understand the basic tailwind functions.
* learning better file structure
